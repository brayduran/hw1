      <title>List of Best Cocktails</title>


    <h1>Duran's List of Best Coktails</h1>
      <p>The art of preparing cocktails dates back centuries, if not millenia. If you find yourself at an upscale restaurant or bar, you can spot the really well trained bartender easily.</p>
      <p>He is the one with the cocktail shaker in one hand while simultaneously reaching for a bottle that he knows the exact location of without looking among the sea of similarly shaped fifths.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it can be scary to undertake the mixing of ones favorite drinks, but this writer hopes to alleviate those pressures with some simple recipes brought together from years of partaking responsibly.</p>
      <p>Simply click through the links to find cocktails made from some of your favorite spirits.</p>

    <h2>Whiskey</h2>
      <p>Whiskey, or whisky in some parts, is one of the families of grain alcohol with the widest spread across the globe, with variants found coming from many distinct regions of the world.</p>
      <p>There is an old tale that if a whiskey is made outside of Kentucky in the US, it must be called mash. That story doesn't actually being to categorize the differences in whiskeys globally.</p>
      <p>Bourbon, or Bourbon Whiskey, while generally made in Kentucky - roughly 95% actually - is a higher proof or alcohol than most liqours at 100-120 proof.</p>
      <p>Tennessee Whiskey is strained essentially bourbon that has been strained through sugar-mapled charcoal, lowering the alcohol content slightly and adding taste.</p>
      <p>Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey are made of at least 51% corn, while American Rye Whiskey needs to be made from at least 51% Rye, but Canadian Rye doesn't need to have any rye in it.</p>
      <p>Order a whiskey in Great Britain, and you most likely would be served Scotch Whisky - note the spelling- made from Malted Barley.</p>
      <p>Order a whiskey in Ireland, and you will be served Irish Whiskey - have to have a different spelling from Great Britain!</p>
      <p>Even more confusing is you can get into malts and blends which is just the different types of whiskey in each bottle.</p>

    <h2>Vodka</h2>
      <p>Vodka is a distilled liqour made mostly of water and ethanol. Flavorings can be added to the base ingredients, but in this posting we will talk mainly of the more pure unflavored vodkas around.</p>
      <p>For most of the last 150 years, most vodkas, especially European vodkas are 40% ABV or 80 proof. Slightly lower than the whiskeys menitoned above.</p>
      <p>Similar to most liqours, vodka is traditionally served neat. Not mixed with ice, water, or other mixers. That kind of puts a damper on our cocktail list, so we won't talk about that anymore.</p>
      <p>While vodkas can be distilled from starch or sugar-rich plant matter, such as potatoe, most vodka today is distilled from grains such as sorghum, corn, rye, or wheat.</p>
      <p>One of the most attractive qualities of vodka is the ability to mix it with almost any flavoring or mixer due to its limited taste of its own.</p>

    <h2>Champagne</h2>
      <p>Champagne is actually only supposed to be applied to sparkling wines made from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France.</p>
      <p>The name champagne is commonly used today in reference to all sparkling wines. The correct term used by the producters are Prosecco and Brut.</p>
      <p>Often associated with nobility and royalty - probably due to clever marketing and branding - champagne has been associtated with high society events.</p>
      <p>Champagne is processed with two different stages of fermentation. After the primary fermentation and bottling, a few grams of yeast and rock sugar are added to the bottle.</p>
      <p>This second fermentation occurs in the bottle and requires a minimum of one and half years to fully ferment before the bottles are deemed good enough to be sold.</p>

    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
      <p>I hope you enjoy a few of my favorite cocktails. Always drink responsibly!</p>
