          <li>Vodka Martini</li>
            <p><img src="Vodka Martini.jpg" width="100px" height="150px"></p>
            <p>The ultimate classic drink, favorites of men such as James Bond, and all those who desire to emulate him.</p>
            <p>In the words of Jed Bartlet: Shaken, not stirred, will get you cold water with a dash of (gin) and dry vermouth.</p>
            <p>The reason you stir it with a special spoon is so not to chip the ice. James is ordering a weak martini and being snooty about it.</p>
            <p>Vermouth is a tricky addition to the martini, at least for those uninitiated in how to order a martini correctly.</p>
            <ol>
              <li> "Dry" refers to the addition of only a splash of vermouth to lend a bitter taste to the drink.</li>
              <li> "Extra Dry" will only have a tiny drizzle of vermouth, or none at all.</li>
              <li> "Wet" martinis will have close to equal parts of vodka and vermouth.</li>
              <li> A "Perfect" martini will have equal parts of dry and sweet vermouth mixed with the vodka.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Ultimately the vodka martini is garnished with 3 olives on a toothpick. Blue Cheese stuffed olives are a favorite.</p>
            <p>The addition of olive juice to the traditional martini will create the "dirty" variation.</p>
          <li>Moscow Mule</li>
            <p><img src="Moscow Mule.jpg" width="100px" height="150px"></p>
            <p>The Mule is a simple yet classic cocktail often served with Brunch. The spicy tastes given by the Ginger Beer help it be good cut the sweet tastes of most sweet brunches.</p>
            <p>Simply mix 2 parts vodka and 4 parts spicy Ginger Beer and add a splash or two of fresh lime juice. Serve over ice in a copper mug and voila.</p>
          <li>Bloody Mary</li>
            <p><img src="Bloody Mary.jpg" width="100px" height="150px"></p>
            <p>The Bloody Mary is a staple of brunches across the world, but perhaps it is served and respected the most in Wisconsin.</p>
            <p>The various restaurants and bars of Milwaukee have made a name for themselves as having some of the best recipses in the world.</p>
            <p>The simplest of recipses are 1 part vodka to 2 parts tomato juice with some type of salt, spices, and garnish.</p>
            <p>Salt or Celery Salt are the most common additions, but the spices and garnish almost never stop there.</p>
            <p>Worcestershire sauce, celery, horshradish, olives, and cheese are common additions to provide more flavor to the Bloody.</p>
          <li>Carmel Appletini</li>
            <p><img src="Caramel Appletini.jpg" width="100px" height="150px"></p>
            <p>Honestly a late addition to this list. My mother-in-law is recently retired to a beach in Florida, and has recently taken a liking to sweet cocktails.</p>
            <p>Yes. You read that correclty. Not sweet as in gnarly, sick, or awesome. Rather, sweet as in sugary. Her other favorite is the Dirty Girl Scout - who knows what's in that.</p>
            <p>Anyways, she was visiting and mentioned her new favorite drink. So logically I had to add it to this list.</p>
            <p>To be honest, I think the name needs some work, you'll get me once you read the ingredients.</p>
            <p>Start with a classic martini glass and drizzle Caramel inside the glass for both taste and asthetics.</p>
            <p>Take a cocktail shaker and pour in 2 ounces of the vodka of your choice (Absolut is her preference),</p>
            <p>add 2 ounces of sour apple pucker and then 2 ounces butterscoth schnappes and a healthy amount of ice. Shake well and pour straight into the glass, no additional ice.</p>
            <p>Optional garnishes include a Maraschino Cherry for looks, Apple slices as a garnish, and pure cane sugar for taste.</p>
        </ol>
